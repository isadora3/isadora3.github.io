<h2>That Time When...</h2>
<p>I flew from Manaus to Rio to Toronto to Boston. Whew! Manaus was hot. Rio was kind of hot. Toronto was cold presumably, but I didn't go outside. I knew I would be happy in my new country when I got to Boston and it was just right.</p>

<h2>I Miss Giant Bugs</h2>
<p>The Amazon was full of big bugs. Big juicy delicious bugs. All New York has is these wimpy tiny roaches. I can barely see them! Maybe I'll find a mouse someday. That'd be something I could really sink my teeth into.</p>

<h2>My Older Sister</h2>
<p>Flashie can be a really grumpy cat, but to the point where it's funny. I like to get a running start from across the room and jump on her (or over her). She's easy to knock over. She only has three legs. Don't judge me; I'm not a monster. After all, who do you think it was that taught her Jiu-jitsu? That's right. Me. Ow.</p>
